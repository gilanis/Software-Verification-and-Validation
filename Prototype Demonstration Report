1.	Introduction
1.1.		Purpose
The purpose of this document is to ensure that the “Making Allergy Information More Accessible at the Point of Care” Prototype Demonstration meets the functional requirements specified in the requirements document and also record the Government Team’s observations, comments and results during the Prototype Demonstration activity and report the corrective action result if there is any deficiency found by the Government Team.
1.2.	Scope
Fully functional and tested Allergy prototype module will be created to highlight clinically-important allergy information for providers at the point of care to reduce the chance of a Veteran receiving a medication to which the Veteran is allergic and improve the safety of medication prescribing in eHMP.
2.	Allergies First Prototype Demonstration
Allergies First Prototype Demonstration on February 4, 2015 was designed to demonstrate only Allergies Information Access and Visibility features at this stage of development.
2.1.	Features Demonstrated
Allergy information Access and Visibility
1)	SR 1.1: System shall allow users to have access to the Veteran’s local and remote allergy Information on the eHMP coversheet. 

2)	SR 1.2: System shall display Veteran’s remote allergy data clearly visible on the coversheet 

3)	SR 1.3: Allergies Applet shall allow the user to view all allergies associated with a patient in a list view. 

4)	SR1.4: Allergies Applet shall allow the user to view all allergies associated with a patient in a detailed view 

5)	SR1.8: Allergies Applet shall allow the user to expand the patient’s existing allergy problems in a list view. 

6)	SR1.9: Allergies Applet shall allow the user to filter and sort patient’s existing allergies. 

7)	SR1.10: System shall allow the user to open and close the modal view of the allergy applet on the coversheet. 

8)	SR1.22: Allergies Applet shall display both local and remote pharmaceutical allergies information in a prominent fashion and shall be visible from any required tab within EHMP. 

9)	SR1.23: Allergies Applet shall display a list of allergies on the Cover Sheet stratified by severity. 

10)	SR1.24: Allergies Applet shall allow provider to determine Severity level of Low to Mild, or High by their diagnosis. 

11)	SR 1.25: Allergies Applet shall allow users to click each allergy separately to see the description of the reaction.
 
12)	SR1.29: System shall include and display the “allergies” on top tool bar of every page of eHMP for both local and remote allergies information. 

13)	SR1.18: System shall allow users to have clearly visible access to Veteran’s allergy Information on the Orders tab while prescribing the medications.
3.	Features Not Demonstrated
Allergies First Prototype Demonstration (February 4, 2015) was designed to demonstrate only Allergies Information Access and Visibility features at this stage of development. All features about allergies information access and visibility included in the first prototype demonstration of the Making Allergy Information More Accessible at the Point of Care has been demonstrated successfully as planned.
4.	Remaining Items to Demonstrate
First prototype demonstration of the Making Allergy Information More Accessible at the Point of Care has completed on Feb 4, 2015 and there are a few remaining items left at this stage of the development. Need to improve these items as Government Team suggested during the demonstration.
o	Name of the local facility should show in 3 letters on the Allergies Tab 
o	Name of the Remote facility should show on the Allergies tab (TBD) 
o	Need to find another place on the cover sheet for Allergies as a second choice, in case of Tool Bar is not available for Allergies Tab.
5.	Government Team’s Observation
The Government team liked the overall demonstration and development work at this stage of eHMP Tool Bar modification to include and display the “Allergies” tab on top tool bar of every page of eHMP for both local and remote allergies information in a prominent fashion (Red Color) and other allergies Information access and visibility features. Team gave a few suggestions as listed under Suggestions heading.
5.1.	Suggestions
Government team suggestions to improve patient’s Allergies information access and visibility features.
i.	Name of the local facility should show in 3 letters on the Allergies Tab 
ii.	Name of the Remote facility should show on the Allergies tab (TBD) 
iii.	Need to find another place on the cover sheet for Allergies as a second choice, in case of Tool Bar is not available for Allergies Tab.
5.2.	Issues Found
No issue was found during the first allergy demonstration limited to, allergies Information access and visibility features, a few suggestions were given as listed above to improve allergies visibility on the coversheet in eHMP.
5.2.1.	Unsatisfactory
The Government team liked the overall demonstration and development work at this stage of development and no unsatisfactory comments was given during the Allergies First Prototype Demonstration on February 4, 2015.
5.2.2.	Failed
No failed issue was reported during the demonstration of the Allergies Information Access and Visibility features at this stage of development of Allergy Applet.
6.	Fixes
(Not applicable at this time)
