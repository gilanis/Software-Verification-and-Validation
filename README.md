# Software-Verification-and-Validation
The process of evaluation to ensure that the product is being built according to the requirements and demonstrate that the product fulfills its intended use when placed in its intended environment.

Verification: The process of evaluating software to determine whether the products of a given development phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase.

Validation: The process of evaluating software during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements.
Verification is quality control, Validation is quality assurance.
